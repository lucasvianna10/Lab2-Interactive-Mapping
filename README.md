Collaborations and Reliance on Other Resources:

  To begin, I had great diffiuclty finding any data that was very interesting to me. So, I thought to my self, why not create my own data. To do this, I went through the mapbox tutorial (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-1/).It was very time consuming, but worthwhile. Then I needed to learn and teach myself how to add interacitivty, which in my case is adding the ability for the user to click on any of the icons, and a info box would appear. To learn how to do this, I relied on the mapbox tutorial, (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-2/). I wanted to change it so that it was a mousover event and not a click event, so I found myself going through this example (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup-on-hover/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem|google|brand|chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&utm_term=brand&utm_content=chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0pfzBRCOARIsANi0g0uPNAUWL2xiMN2fJS8UMvroKfH5iZiwIVVvRnFF5Ty8xUOLwUg7UREaAtJjEALw_wcB). However, after many failed attempts, I decided to stick with the click option. I also relied on a tutorial by mapbox in order to create a text box for the title of the map. I also went back to a couple of the lectures and slides that were presented in class on the topic of writing in HTML to get a better grip of what I was creating in the text editor Atom. I also looked at this example (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/animate-point-along-route/), as I wanted to animate a point along a line between two airports. However, after a lot of time spent with the code, It did not work for me unfortunately. In my very short and brief peer critique, I was told to perhaps change the colour of my icons, as red does not neccesarily represnt skiing. However, I choose to stick with red as I beleive it makes it pop and stand out, and is a great contrast colour from the basemap. 
  
 
 Reflective Analysis:
 -
  For this lab, I set out with the goal of creating a map that has interaction. But what does interaction actually mean? According to Roth (2017), interaction is "the two-way question answer or request-result dialogue between a human user and a digital object mediated through a computing device". Therefore, I had to find data that was both meaningful, and could involve some sort of interactivity.
  
 My map was desinged for the general public, for those who actively participate in skiing and snowboarding. More specifically, it involves point data of all of the ski resort locations that are included in the 'Epic Pass' offered by Vail Resorts. The 'Epic Pass' is a card that allows you to ski and snowboard at ALL of these locations for as long as you want all season long. Therefore, this map was more specifically designed for people who have purchased this pass and are considering travelling to different resorts throughout the season. It enables the user of the map to locate all of the locations of the resorts, and then see where the closest international aiport to each resort is. This would allow the user to be able to make travel plans and see where they need to fly to in order to ski at that specific location. So a question that I was considering when creating the map was, if I have an 'epic pass' and want to ski at ALL of the locations that are included in the pass, first; where are all of these resorts located?, and second; what airports are closest to these resorts? I beleive my map is successful in answering these questions, as it allows the user to visualize it all. The map could be successfully used by someone who is planning a long ski trip or vacation that involves multiple different resorts. 
 
 The process that I followed in the design of the map involved many steps. First, I decided to go with the template style 'Navigation' offered by Mapbox. In order to limit the amount of distracting elements within the map, I turned off multiple place labels such as countries, settlements and settlement subvisions. Furthermore, becasue the purpose of the map had nothing to do with road network data, I turned off all of the attributes located in the 'Road Network' component. This left me with a nice and clean basemap. I changed the colour of the water in the ocean to blue colour instead of a grey. The next step was uploading the data. The data involved in this map was not downloaded from an eternal source, by rather created through the mapbox data editor by me. ( yes every single point data was conducted manually (even the ones in Australia)). I found the long/lat coordinates of the ski resorts, and created point data on the map. The same was done for the airports. However, to make these data points more cartographically appealing, I attached specific icons to them. The icon for the ski resorts is represented as a skier. For the airports, it is a plane. I chose the colour red for the ski resorts because I wanted it to stand out and pop. The red contrasts well over the dark green colour of the land. The airport icon was made white, as it keeps it clean and simple, and also adds nice contrast from the red. I changed the icon colours by going the the Maki Icons editor website and then uploading to mapbox. 
 
 This map incorporates interactivity in way that adds understanding. The interactivity involved is understood as 'displaying a pop up on click'. So when the user clicks on one of the icons, a pop up will appear with a text box which includes the name of the resort/ airport. The ski resort icons also include information about how long the drive takes in KM's to get from the airport to that ski resort. So withouth the interactivity of the pop up event, the user would not know what the name of the ski resort is, how far it is from the closest airport and so forth. The data would bassicaly just be on the map and would be very difficult to understand its purpose. In order for the user to know that there is interactivity involved, an affordance had to be created. According to Roth(2017), affordance is defined as "a signal to the user about how to interact with the interface". Within the HTML code, I successfuly added an information box at the top right of the map. There I have the title, and underneath the title I have an affordance, telling the user to click on the ski and airport icons. 
 
 Although I beleive my map does a good job at visualizng the data and incorporating interactivity to add understanding, it still could be improved in various ways. My fellow classmate suggested that I could have added buffers around the airports to see the range of ski resorts in a certain distance. Also, another classmate suggested that I should try and implement away to avoid label/icon overlap, as in some locations the airport and ski resort are super close to eachother. One of the biggest ways I personally wanted to improve my map was by adding more interactivity through another data set. I wanted to incorporate the average amount of snowfall in each state in the USA, and visualize this by creating a chloropleth. Then I wanted to create a mouse over event, where when you hovered over a state, it would tell you the average amount of snowfall each year. This would be beneifical for the desinged user of the map, as they could see where the most snow is historically, and then travel to that location in hopes of getting the best ski vacation possible! Unfortunately, after hours of searching for this snow data, I could not find any, and was quite dissapointed. I thought about adding it manually, but that is a whole project within itself. 
 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this Lab. It was very difficult trying to learn and implement the specific code for adding specific interactivity for me. However, I enjoyed pushing myself to place where I was unfamiliar with and forcing myself to try over and over again.
