Collaborations and reliance on other Resources:

  To begin, I had great diffiuclty finding any data that was very interesting to me. So, I thought to my self, why not create my own data. To do this, I went through the mapbox tutorial (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-1/).It was very time consuming, but worthwhile. Then I needed to learn and teach myself how to add interacitivty, which in my case is adding the ability for the user to click on any of the icons, and a info box would appear. To learn how to do this, I relied on the mapbox tutorial, (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-2/). I wanted to change it so that it was a mousover event and not a click event, so I found myself going through this example (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup-on-hover/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem|google|brand|chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&utm_term=brand&utm_content=chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0pfzBRCOARIsANi0g0uPNAUWL2xiMN2fJS8UMvroKfH5iZiwIVVvRnFF5Ty8xUOLwUg7UREaAtJjEALw_wcB). However, after many failed attempts, I decided to stick with the click option. I also relied on a tutorial by mapbox in order to create a text box for the title of the map.
