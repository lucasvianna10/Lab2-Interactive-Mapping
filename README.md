Collaborations and reliance on other Resources:

  To begin, I had great diffiuclty finding any data that was very interesting to me. So, I thought to my self, why not create my own data. To do this, I went through the mapbox tutorial (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-1/).It was very time consuming, but worthwhile. Then I needed to learn and teach myself how to add interacitivty, which in my case is adding the ability for the user to click on any of the icons, and a info box would appear. To learn how to do this, I relied on the mapbox tutorial, (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-2/). I wanted to change it so that it was a mousover event and not a click event, so I found myself going through this example (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup-on-hover/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem|google|brand|chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&utm_term=brand&utm_content=chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0pfzBRCOARIsANi0g0uPNAUWL2xiMN2fJS8UMvroKfH5iZiwIVVvRnFF5Ty8xUOLwUg7UREaAtJjEALw_wcB). However, after many failed attempts, I decided to stick with the click option. I also relied on a tutorial by mapbox in order to create a text box for the title of the map. I also went back to a couple of the lectures and slides that were presented in class on the topic of writing in HTML to get a better grip of what I was creating in the text editor Atom. I also looked at this example (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/animate-point-along-route/), as I wanted to animate a point along a line between two airports. However, after a lot of time spent with the code, It did not work for me unfortunately. In my very short and brief peer critique, I was told to perhaps change the colour of my icons, as red does not neccesarily represnt skiing. However, I choose to stick with red as I beleive it makes it pop and stand out, and is a great contrast colour from the basemap. 
  
 
 Reflective Analysis:

  For this lab, I set out with the goal of creating a map that has interaction. But what does interaction actually mean? According to Roth (2017), interaction is "the two-way question answer or request-result dialogue between a human user and a digital object mediated through a computing device". Therefore, I had to find data that was both meaningful, and could involve some sort of interactivity.
  
 My map was desinged for the general public, for those who actively participate in skiing and snowboarding. More specifically, it involves point data of all of the ski resort locations that are included in the 'Epic Pass' offered by Vail Resorts. The 'Epic Pass' is a card that allows you to ski and snowboard at ALL of these locations for as long as you want all season long. Therefore, this map was more specifically designed for people who have purchased this pass and are considering travelling to different resorts throughout the season. It enables the user of the map to locate all of the locations of the resorts, and then see where the closest international aiport to each resort is. This would allow the user to be able to make travel plans and see where they need to fly to in order to ski at that specific location. So a question that I was considering when creating the map was, if I have an 'epic pass' and want to ski at ALL of the locations that are included in the pass, first; where are all of these resorts located?, and second; what airports are closest to these resorts? I beleive my map is successful in answering these questions, as it allows the user to visualize it all. The map could be successfully used by someone who is planning a long ski trip or vacation that involves multiple different resorts.
